NAME OF THE PROJECT : BATTLESHIP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ABOUT CODE AND ITS ALGO:

This code implements a simplified version of the Battleship game for two players. Let's go through it step by step:

1. *Imports*:
   - The random module is imported to generate random numbers for placing the battleship on the board.

2. *create_board(size) Function*:
   - This function takes an integer size as input and returns a 2D list representing the game board filled with 'O' characters. The size of the board is size x size.

3. *print_board(board) Function*:
   - This function takes a 2D list board as input and prints it in a user-friendly format. It iterates over each row of the board and prints the elements separated by spaces.

4. *place_ship(board) Function*:
   - This function takes the game board as input.
   - It generates random coordinates (ship_row and ship_col) within the boundaries of the board using random.randint().
   - It ensures that the generated coordinates do not overlap with an existing ship (if any) by checking if the cell already contains a ship ('S'). If it does, it generates new coordinates until it finds an empty cell.
   - Once it finds an empty cell, it places the ship ('S') at that location and returns the coordinates.

5. *get_guess(board) Function*:
   - This function takes the game board as input.
   - It prompts the user to input the row and column they want to guess.
   - It validates the input to ensure that the row and column numbers are within the boundaries of the board.
   - It returns the validated row and column numbers (adjusted by 1 to match 0-based indexing).

6. *play_battleship(player) Function*:
   - This function simulates the gameplay for a single player.
   - It initializes the game board, places the battleship on the board, and prints the initial state of the board.
   - It iterates through a fixed number of turns (4 in this case), allowing the player to make guesses.
   - For each turn, it prompts the player for their guess, checks if the guess hits the enemy battleship, updates the board accordingly, and prints the updated board.
   - If the player successfully hits the battleship, it congratulates the player and ends the game.
   - If the player exhausts all turns without hitting the battleship, it prints the location of the enemy battleship and ends the game.

7. *Main Execution*:
   - The code block under if __name__ == "__main__": is the entry point of the script.
   - It prints a message to start the Battleship game.
   - It prompts Player 1 and Player 2 in sequence to place their battleships and play the game.

Overall, this code provides a command-line interface for playing the Battleship game. Players take turns guessing the locations of each other's battleships, and the game ends when one player successfully hits the opponent's battleship or when all turns are exhausted.

//IF WE TRIED IT TO DISPLAY IN WEBPAGE ,OUR IDEA WILL BE LOOK LIKE:
